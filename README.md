Thank you for taking the time to view my portfolio!
Below are brief descriptions of each project within this repository:
** For projects that have been incorporated into some of my coursework, I have specified what year I worked on them as such.**

1. City Ninja _Sophomore_ (In Development):
   Welcome to City Ninja (working title). In this high energy endless runner, players take on the role of a ninja who is on the run from the samurai authorities and must survive for as long as they can.  
   Players engage in reaction-based parkour and rapid-decision making as they jump, slice, and dodge their way through obstacles and enemies to get the highest score possible.
   I began developing this game as a project for my university's Game Design course and as a chance to acquaint myself with the Unity engine and the C# language. Following the completion of the course,
   I decided to continue developing the game as a side project. For specifics on what I have planned for the game, please refer to the GDD also located within this repository.

2. Shrubby's Pinecone Collector _Freshman_:
   In this small game made for my university's Intro to Interactive Animation course, players take on the role of Shrubby, a forest monster that's been placed in charge of collecting pinecones for the
   upcoming Forest Festival. Unfortunately the squirrels of the forest also want those pinecones and will do anything they can stop Shrubby. Help Shrubby collect the pinecones by guiding him and his trusty basket
   to the pinecones and away from danger. Players must try to get as many pinecones in Shrubby's basket as they can before the squirrels break it with their trusty spike balls. After finshing the course, I decided to
   stop development of this project to learn other game making programs aside from Adobe Animate (specifically, Unity and Unreal) and develop other personal projects. If you would like to play this game, here is a link
   to the project: https://jacobmendoza.lmu.build/ANIM250/ (Note: The game only works on Desktop Chrome)

3. Project Prismborn _Junior_:
   Project Prismborn (working title) is a passion project of mine that is currently in the purely conceptual stage. I intend for the game to be a 3D Action RPG set in a world where a small fraction of the population
   are born with the power to control the elements. Players will take control of a central cast of characters that will embark on an adventure that makes up the story mode of the game. Within this current iteration of this
   portfolio are some early level design concepts and a few character design concepts that I intend on fleshing out more.
